# Lessons Learned:

Added Tailwind for the first time, trying to make stylish webapp in a short period of time, specially in design. 

In the future I would like to implement friends, tags, blurred face if the person that is in the photo don't like it, and add a choice for Google Authentication for login.

# How to Get it Working:

Add a .env file in the config folder with these two values:
* PORT = 2121 //or whatever you choose
* DB_STRING =  //MongoDB connection string
* CLOUD_NAME = //Cloudinary Cloud Name
* API_KEY =    //Cloudinary API Key
* API_SECRET = //Cloudinary API Secret
